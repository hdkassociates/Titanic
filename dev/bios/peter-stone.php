<p>Stone was born in Los Angeles. His mother was a film writer and his father was the writer and producer of many silent films. </p>
<p>Stone is among that rarefied group of writers who have conquered stage, screen, and television by winning an Oscar, a Tony, and an Emmy. In 1965, he won an Oscar for his work as a screenwriter on <em>Father Goose</em>, however it is the Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn vehicle, <em>Charade</em>, that is probably Stone's best-remembered film. He won Tony Awards for his books for the Broadway musicals <em>Titanic, Woman Of The Year</em> and <em>1776</em>. He won an Emmy for a 1962 episode of <em>The Defenders</em>.</p>
<p>Shortly after Stone's death, in a memorial ceremony it was observed that the two most famous ships of all time were Noah&rsquo;s Ark and the Titanic, and that Stone had written Broadway Musicals about both of them.</p>
